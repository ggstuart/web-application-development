This module introduces the technologies involved in building an **accessible** and **responsive** website with **dynamic** content.
Each week there will be three lectures introducing concepts and three lab sessions where you will get your hands dirty.

### Mozilla Developer Network

The most important source of information on web technologies is the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) or *MDN* for short.

>The MDN webdocs include references and tutorials for the core technologies **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**.

Wherever possible, we will link to the MDN page for things.
However, if we forget to link, or if you are searching for something we don't cover, then simply add *"MDN"* to your search engine query and you should find what you need. 

>For example, try searching for *"MDN grid"* and you should find the [MDN grid layout page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids).
Though *be careful* because you will also find the documentation for the [grid property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) which will assume you already know about grid layouts.

MDN is vast and comprehensive, including content for all levels of experience. 
It's usually worth checking the first few search results within MDN as one may be exactly what you are looking for.
