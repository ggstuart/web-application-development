In this module we will focus on the core technologies which underpin the web.
The web is built on standards which are evolving fast.
Web clients (browsers) continually expand their support for these evolving standards.
Web server frameworks provide convenient tools that help us to build web servers.

By the end of the module you should be comfortable building a web application from scratch.
