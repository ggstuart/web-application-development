This unit will cover *flex* and *grid*, the two major alternative ways to arrange elements on a page.

Both *flex* and *grid* layouts are newer additions to CSS specification but they have both become ubiquitous on the web and largely replaced older, less convenient ways to layout your page. 

To use either layout we set the *display* property on a *parent* element in order to control the layout of that element's *children*.
