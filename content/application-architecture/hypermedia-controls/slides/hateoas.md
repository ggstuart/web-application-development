The architectural style of the web is known as **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer (REST).

>One of the key pillars of RESTful architecture is **HyperMedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)**.
>
> In HATEOAS, the client (browser) has no knowledge of your application.
All it knows is the entry point URL (possibly a hyperlink from another site).
> It receives **hypermedia controls** embedded in HTML.
>
>Hypermedia controls allow the user to make subsequent requests that change the state of the application.

This is Roy Fielding. 
He described REST in his PhD thesis in 2000.
