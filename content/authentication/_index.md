title: Cookies and authentication

HTTP is a stateless protocol meaning that each request is processed independently by the server and clients must resend all the context with every request.

However, our applications often need to know who is sending a request. 
We can achieve this using cookies to simulate sessions which can be associated with authenticated users.
