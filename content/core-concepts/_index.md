This unit will cover the fundamentals of how Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for describing content on the web.

HTML is defined as an open standard and was one of the core technologies originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee.
When we browse to a website, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server. 
The server may return static HTML files or generate the HTML content dynamically.

HTML documents are simple text files.
We wrap content with HTML tags to indicate the meaning of the content.
Front-end web development is all about working within the browser to construct user interfaces using HTML and CSS as the core technologies.

This introductory unit will cover the basics, assuming you know nothing about HTML and CSS.
We will attempt to cover the main topics and leave you with enough experience to find what you need on the web.
