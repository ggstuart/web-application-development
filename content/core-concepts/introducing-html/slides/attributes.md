Elements can have attributes to add information that should not be considered content. Attributes are key/value pairs separated by an equals symbol.

```html
<p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy.</p>
```
>Attributes are placed inside the opening tag.
Pay attention to the details.

```html
<p attribute="this-is-wrong"attribute2="this-is-wrong">
    Missing space between attributes
</p>
<p attribute1=value3>
    Missing quotes
</p>
```
