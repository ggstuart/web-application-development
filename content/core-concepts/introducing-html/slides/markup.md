Markup refers to literally *making marks on a written manuscript* to indicate how it should be treated when printed.
Markup languages *add information about the content*.

```html {{linenos=true}}
<h2>Markup</h2>
<p>
    Markup refers to the <em>marking up</em> of text
    (e.g. literally making marks on a manuscript)
    to indicate how it should be treated when printed.
</p>
```
The above content is **marked up** to indicate that the first line is a level 2 heading and the rest of the text should be combined into one paragraph. 
Emphasis has been added to a few of the words.

> Note that HTML does not include any information about *how* to format **content**.
It simply indicates what *kind* of **content** the various parts of the document are.
