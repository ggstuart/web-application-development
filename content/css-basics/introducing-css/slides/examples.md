> CSS declarations are a way to set CSS properties of elements to given values.
> The **selector** determines which elements are targetted by the ruleset.

```css {hl_lines="1 5 9 14"}
body {
    margin: 0;
}

p {
    color: green;
}

a {
    text-decoration: underline;
    color: blue;
}

li {
    padding-block: 1em;
    background-color: yellow;
}

```

> In the above examples the *selectors* are *body*, *p* and *a* respectively.
