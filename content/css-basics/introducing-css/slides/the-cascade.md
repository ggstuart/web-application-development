Essentially there are three types of stylesheets.

> - *Browser* stylesheets (user-agent stylesheets) provide a base set of default styles.
> - *User* stylesheets (no longer common) are custom styles set by the browser user.
> - *Author* stylesheets (the ones we write as developers) are embedded or linked in the HTML document.

Conflicting styles are applied by an algorithm known as *the cascade* (as in *Cascading Style Sheets*).
The algorithm is fairly complex but for our purposes we can simplify it.
