title: A books page
weight: 9
author: Dr Graeme Stuart
---

In this exercise we will add a books page which shows every book in our database as a card, with its cover.
Along the way we will pass data from a model, through a controller, to a view.

<!--more-->

> You should have a books database with 20 books from the [previous exercise][previous exercise].
> If you have been experimenting, run `deno task db:reset` to get back to 20.
> Before you start, make sure everything is committed to your git repository.

## Learning objectives

The books page is a new *feature*.
We will build it one small step at a time, checking the browser after each one.
By the end of this exercise you should be able to:

- Add a page with a view and a controller, and explain the technical debt it adds
- Pass data from a model to a view through `render`
- Turn an array of books into HTML with `map` and `join`
- Explain what a *partial* is and why we use one
- Lay out a page of cards with CSS grid, including a grid inside each card

## Setup

Start the server in development mode.

```bash {linenos=false}
deno task dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8000/][localhost] with the developer tools (**F12**) open on the **network** panel.
Click the **books** link in the header.

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
content-type: text/html
content-length: 1083
date: Thu, 29 Oct 2026 14:33:35 GMT
```

The link has been there since we added the header, but it goes to our not-found page.
Let's fix that.

## A books view and controller {#books-controller}

This will feel familiar.
Every page so far has a view and a [controller][controllers], and the books page is no different.

Create **books.js** in the **server/views** folder.

**server/views/books.js**
```JavaScript
export function booksView() {
    return `
        <section>
            <header>
                <h1>Books</h1>
                <p>All the books in Bookshelves.</p>
            </header>
        </section>
    `;
}
```

Then create **books.js** in the **server/controllers** folder.

**server/controllers/books.js**
```JavaScript
import { render } from "../tools/render.js";
import { booksView } from "../views/books.js";

export function booksController() {
    return render(booksView, { title: "Books" });
}
```

Click [http://localhost:8000/books][books].
It's still our not-found page, with `404 Not Found` in the **network** panel.

Nothing calls `booksController` yet.
Our request handler in **server/main.js** decides which controller to call, and it doesn't know about the books page.

## Routing to the books page {#route}

Update **server/main.js** to import the new controller and call it for `/books`.

**server/main.js**
```JavaScript{hl_lines="3 22-24"}
import { serveDir } from "@std/http";
import { homeController } from "./controllers/home.js";
import { booksController } from "./controllers/books.js";
import { notFoundController } from "./controllers/notFound.js";

export function server(request) {
    const url = new URL(request.url);

    // Placeholder: this will need to change when we add middleware
    console.log(request.method, url.pathname);

    // Placeholder: this will need to change when we add a router
    if (url.pathname.startsWith("/assets/")) {
        return serveDir(request, {
            fsRoot: "public",
            urlRoot: "assets",
        });
    }
    if (url.pathname === "/") {
        return homeController();
    }
    if (url.pathname === "/books") {
        return booksController();
    }
    return notFoundController();
}
```

Refresh [http://localhost:8000/books][books].

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: text/html
content-length: 1067
date: Thu, 29 Oct 2026 14:33:37 GMT
```

The tab says **Books | Bookshelves** and the page has a heading.
[http://localhost:8000/][localhost] and [http://localhost:8000/nope][nope] are just as they were.

### Another if {#if-chain}

Look at the `if` statements in **server/main.js**.
Every page we add needs another one, and they all look the same.
This is [technical debt][technical debt], and it grows with every page.
The router placeholder is a reminder that we will pay it off when we add a router.

## Passing data to the view {#passing-data}

Our page has no books yet.
The books are in our [model][mvc], and the view needs them.
`render` calls the view, so `render` must pass the books on.

Update **server/tools/render.js** so that `render` takes a `data` option and gives it to the view.

**server/tools/render.js**
```JavaScript{hl_lines="4 6"}
import { layout } from "../views/layout.js";

// Placeholder: this will need to change when we add ctx
export function render(view, { status, title, data } = {}) {
    const headers = new Headers({ "content-type": "text/html" });
    return new Response(layout(view({ data }), { title }), { headers, status });
}
```

`data` is another property in our [options object][options].
`render` now calls `view({ data })`, so every view receives an object with a `data` property.

> Our home and not-found views take no arguments, so they simply ignore it.
> Refresh [http://localhost:8000/][localhost] to check.

Now update **server/controllers/books.js** to get the books from the model and pass them to `render`.

**server/controllers/books.js**
```JavaScript{hl_lines="1 6-7"}
import { getBooks } from "../models/books.js";
import { render } from "../tools/render.js";
import { booksView } from "../views/books.js";

export function booksController() {
    const books = getBooks();
    return render(booksView, { title: "Books", data: { books } });
}
```

The controller asks the model for the books with `getBooks`, and passes them to `render` inside `data`.

Finally, update **server/views/books.js** to use the books.

**server/views/books.js**
```JavaScript{hl_lines="1 7-9 14-16"}
export function booksView({ data: { books } }) {
    return `
        <section>
            <header>
                <h1>Books</h1>
            </header>
            <ul>
                ${books.map(bookItem).join("")}
            </ul>
        </section>
    `;
}

function bookItem(book) {
    return `<li>${book.title}</li>`;
}
```

`booksView({ data: { books } })` uses [destructuring][destructuring] twice.
It takes the `data` property from the argument, and then the `books` property from `data`.
So inside the view, `books` is our array of books.

`bookItem` takes one book and returns a list item containing its title.

[`map`][array map] calls a function on every item in an array and gives us a new array of the results.
We pass `bookItem` itself to `map`, without brackets, just as we [passed views to render][first-class function].
So `books.map(bookItem)` is an array of 20 strings, one for each book.

> `bookItem` isn't exported.
> It is only used by the books view, so it stays in this module.

[`join`][array join] joins the strings in an array into one string.
We give it `""` so that nothing goes between them.

> Without `join`, the template literal would turn the array into a string itself, with a comma between each item.

Refresh [http://localhost:8000/books][books].
You should see a bulleted list of our 20 titles.
View the page source (**Ctrl + U**) and look at the list.

```html {linenos=false}
            <ul>
                <li>The Hunger Games</li><li>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</li><li>Twilight</li><li>To Kill a Mockingbird</li><li>The Great Gatsby</li><li>The Fault in Our Stars</li><li>The Hobbit</li><li>The Catcher in the Rye</li><li>Pride and Prejudice</li><li>Angels & Demons</li><li>The Diary of a Young Girl</li><li>1984</li><li>Divergent</li><li>Animal Farm</li><li>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</li><li>Catching Fire</li><li>The Kite Runner</li><li>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</li><li>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</li><li>The Fellowship of the Ring</li>
            </ul>
```

Each `<li>` is one string from `map`, joined with nothing between them.

All three parts of [model-view-controller][mvc] now work together.
The controller asks the model for the books, and gives them to the view.
The view doesn't know where the books came from, and the model doesn't know anything about HTML.

### Removing the books task {#remove-books-task}

When we [listed the books in the terminal][get books] we promised that the `books` task was temporary.
The books page does its job now.

Delete **tasks/books.js** and remove the `books` task from **deno.json**.

**deno.json**
```json{hl_lines="7"}
{
    "tasks": {
        "serve": "deno -A tasks/server.js",
        "dev": "deno --watch -A tasks/server.js",
        "db:create": "deno -A tasks/db-create.js",
        "db:seed": "deno -A tasks/db-seed.js",
        "db:reset": "deno task db:create && deno task db:seed"
    },
    "imports": {
        "@db/sqlite": "jsr:@db/sqlite@^0.12.0",
        "@std/http": "jsr:@std/http@^1.1.4"
    }
}
```

> Don't forget to remove the comma at the end of the `db:reset` line, now that it's the last task.

```bash {linenos=false}
deno task books
```

```plaintext {linenos=false}
Task not found: books
Available tasks:
- serve
    deno -A tasks/server.js
- dev
    deno --watch -A tasks/server.js
- db:create
    deno -A tasks/db-create.js
- db:seed
    deno -A tasks/db-seed.js
- db:reset
    deno task db:create && deno task db:seed
```

The task has gone.

## A grid of books {#grid}

A long bulleted list isn't a good way to browse books.
We want them side by side, in as many columns as fit the window.

Give the list a `class` in **server/views/books.js**.

**server/views/books.js**
```JavaScript{hl_lines="7"}
export function booksView({ data: { books } }) {
    return `
        <section>
            <header>
                <h1>Books</h1>
            </header>
            <ul class="grid">
                ${books.map(bookItem).join("")}
            </ul>
        </section>
    `;
}

function bookItem(book) {
    return `<li>${book.title}</li>`;
}
```

Then add a `.grid` rule to the end of **public/styles.css**.

**public/styles.css**
```css {linenostart="79"}
/* auto-fill makes as many columns as fit, each at least 15rem wide */
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(15rem, 1fr));
    gap: 1rem;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
}
```

We have used a grid before, for the [rows of our page][styles].
This time we set the columns.

- [*grid-template-columns*][grid-template-columns] describes the columns.
- [`repeat(auto-fill, …)`][repeat] makes as many columns as will fit.
- [`minmax(15rem, 1fr)`][minmax] makes each column at least *15rem* wide, and shares out any space left over equally.
- *gap* puts space between the books.
- `padding: 0` and `list-style: none` remove the indent and bullets that a list has *by default*.

Refresh [http://localhost:8000/books][books] and change the width of the window.
The number of columns changes to fit.

> `class="grid"` describes the layout, not the books.
> Any list we want to show as a grid can use it.

## A card for each book {#partials}

Each book will be a *card*, a box with the book's details in it.
`bookItem` is about to grow, and we may want to show a book card on other pages one day.

Create a folder called **partials** inside the **server/views** folder, with a file called **bookCard.js**.

**server/views/partials/bookCard.js**
```JavaScript
export function bookCard(book) {
    return `
        <li class="card">
            <div>
                <h2>${book.title}</h2>
                <p>${book.author} (${book.year})</p>
            </div>
        </li>
    `;
}
```

`bookCard` is a *partial*.
A partial is a small view used inside other views.
Like every view, it is a function that returns HTML.
Our partials live in their own folder, so we can tell them apart from whole pages.

```plaintext {linenos=false, hl_lines="4-5"}
my-app/
├── server/
│   ├── views/
│   │   ├── partials/
│   │   │   └── bookCard.js
│   │   ├── books.js
│   │   ├── home.js
│   │   ├── layout.js
│   │   └── notFound.js
│   └── …
└── …
```

Update **server/views/books.js** to import `bookCard` and use it instead of `bookItem`.

**server/views/books.js**
```JavaScript{hl_lines="1-2 10"}
import { bookCard } from "./partials/bookCard.js";

export function booksView({ data: { books } }) {
    return `
        <section>
            <header>
                <h1>Books</h1>
            </header>
            <ul class="grid">
                ${books.map(bookCard).join("")}
            </ul>
        </section>
    `;
}
```

> `bookItem` has gone.
> `bookCard` does its job, with the author and year too.

Each card has a heading, so let's give `<h2>` elements the same weight as `<h1>` near the top of **public/styles.css**.

**public/styles.css**
```css {linenostart="14" hl_lines="1-2"}
h1,
h2 {
    font-weight: 400;
}
```

Then add a `.card` rule to the end of the file.

**public/styles.css**
```css {linenostart="89"}
/* A card is a bordered box with rounded corners */
.card {
    border: 1px solid;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;

    > div:last-child {
        padding: 0.5rem;
    }

    h2,
    p {
        margin: 0;
        font-size: 1em;
    }
}
```

[`> div:last-child`][last-child] is nested inside `.card`, like the `& > header` in our `body` rule.
It means the last `<div>` directly inside a card, which holds the text.
The headings and paragraphs inside a card lose their margins and are all the same size.

Refresh [http://localhost:8000/books][books].
Each book is now a bordered box with its title, author and year.

## Covers {#cover}

Books are easier to find by their covers.
Add an [`<img>`][img] to the card in **server/views/partials/bookCard.js**.

**server/views/partials/bookCard.js**
```JavaScript{hl_lines="4"}
export function bookCard(book) {
    return `
        <li class="card">
            <img class="cover" src="${book.coverUrl}" alt="" width="200" height="300" loading="lazy">
            <div>
                <h2>${book.title}</h2>
                <p>${book.author} (${book.year})</p>
            </div>
        </li>
    `;
}
```

- `class="cover"` lets us style book covers.
- `alt=""` tells screen readers the image is decorative, because the title is right next to it.
- `width` and `height` tell the browser the shape of the image before it arrives, so the page doesn't jump about as covers load.
- [`loading="lazy"`][lazy loading] waits to load a cover until it is near the visible part of the page.

> Some books in **books.json** have no cover, so their `coverUrl` is `null`.
> None of our 20 books are like that, so we can leave them for now.

Add an `img` rule to **public/styles.css**, after the `nav` rule.

**public/styles.css**
```css {linenostart="80"}
/* Pictures never overflow their box */
img {
    max-inline-size: 100%;
}
```

Pictures can be wider than the box they are in.
This rule stops any image from overflowing its box.

Then add `overflow: clip` to `.card`, and a `.cover` rule after it.

**public/styles.css**
```css {linenostart="94" hl_lines="5 18-24"}
/* A card is a bordered box with rounded corners */
.card {
    border: 1px solid;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    overflow: clip;

    > div:last-child {
        padding: 0.5rem;
    }

    h2,
    p {
        margin: 0;
        font-size: 1em;
    }
}

/* A book cover is always 2:3, cropped to fit */
.cover {
    inline-size: 100%;
    block-size: auto;
    aspect-ratio: 2 / 3;
    object-fit: cover;
}
```

- [*aspect-ratio*][aspect-ratio] makes every cover the same shape, *2 / 3*, however big it is.
- [*object-fit*][object-fit] with *cover* fills that shape, cropping the picture if it isn't quite the right shape.
- `overflow: clip` on the card cuts off the corners of the cover, so they follow the card's rounded border.

Refresh [http://localhost:8000/books][books].
Each card now has its cover at the top, the full width of the card.

## A grid inside each card {#card-grid}

Our cards are tall.
We will put the cover and the text side by side, which needs a grid inside each card.

Start with the grid itself.
Update the `.card` rule in **public/styles.css**.

**public/styles.css**
```css {linenostart="94" hl_lines="1 3 7 9 11-13"}
/* A card is a bordered box with rounded corners. Each kind of card sets its own grid */
.card {
    display: grid;
    border: 1px solid;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    overflow: clip;
    overflow-wrap: anywhere; /* a very long word breaks, rather than squashing the cover */

    /* The text is spread from the top of the card to the bottom */
    > div:last-child {
        display: grid;
        align-content: space-between;
        gap: 0.5rem;
        padding: 0.5rem;
    }

    h2,
    p {
        margin: 0;
        font-size: 1em;
    }
}
```

- `display: grid` makes each card a grid. We haven't set any columns, so it has one column and the cover sits above the text, just as before.
- [*overflow-wrap*][overflow-wrap] with *anywhere* lets a very long word break, rather than making its column wider and squashing the cover.
- The text `<div>` is a grid too. [*align-content*][align-content] with *space-between* puts the title at the top of the card and the author at the bottom.

Refresh [http://localhost:8000/books][books].
The cover is still above the text, because each card still has one column.
The only difference is a little more space between the title and the author, from the new *gap*.

Different kinds of card will want different columns, so each kind sets its own.
Add a `.card.book` rule to the end of **public/styles.css**.

**public/styles.css**
```css {linenostart="124"}

/* A book card: the cover in a narrow column, the text beside it */
.card.book {
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 3fr;
}
```

`.card.book` matches elements with both classes.
The two columns are measured in [`fr`][fr], a share of the space, so the cover gets two parts and the text gets three.

Add the `book` class to the card in **server/views/partials/bookCard.js**.

**server/views/partials/bookCard.js**
```JavaScript{hl_lines="3"}
export function bookCard(book) {
    return `
        <li class="card book">
            <img class="cover" src="${book.coverUrl}" alt="" width="200" height="300" loading="lazy">
            <div>
                <h2>${book.title}</h2>
                <p>${book.author} (${book.year})</p>
            </div>
        </li>
    `;
}
```

Refresh [http://localhost:8000/books][books].
Each card now has its cover on the left and its title, author and year on the right.
Our books page is finished, for now.

> Make the window narrow and wide again.
> The cards and the columns all adjust together.

## Conclusion

We added a books page, our first page to show data from the database.
We followed the same pattern as before, a view, a controller and one more `if` in **server/main.js**.
`render` gained a `data` option, so the controller can pass the books from the model to the view.
We turned the books into HTML with `map` and `join`, moved each book's HTML into a partial, and laid the cards out with a grid inside a grid.
The temporary `books` task has gone.

We also added some debt.
Our `if` chain is longer.

Our project now looks like this.

## Challenge: Experiment with the books page

- In the `.card.book` rule, try `1fr 1fr` or `1fr 3fr` instead of `2fr 3fr`. Which looks best at different window widths?
- In the `.grid` rule, change *15rem* to *10rem* or *25rem* and watch the number of columns.
- In the **Elements** panel, select a card and untick `display: grid` on `.card`, and then `object-fit: cover` on `.cover`. What does each one do?
- Change `20` to `100` in **tasks/db-seed.js**, run `deno task db:reset` and refresh [http://localhost:8000/books][books]. How long does the page take to scroll through? Do any cards look wrong?

> Put **public/styles.css** and **tasks/db-seed.js** back to the versions above, then run `deno task db:reset` before moving on.

Finally, something to think about.
Our books page shows every book in the database.
What would happen with all 1,000?
