Gaining experience working with web technologies is a critical part of the learning in this module. 

> Exercises should be completed each week in preparations for and during the lab sessions.

Lab exercises are provided for you to complete in your own time and in the timetabled labs.
There will often not be enough time to complete all exercises within timetabled labs so you will need to complete these exercises in your own time.
