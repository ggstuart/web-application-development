>"(...)'Hypertext' is a recent coinage. 'Hyper-' is used in the mathematical sense of extension and generality (as in 'hyperspace,' 'hypercube') rather than the medical sense of 'excessive' ('hyperactivity'). There is no implication about sizeâ€” a hypertext could contain only 500 words or so. 'Hyper-' refers to structure and not size."
