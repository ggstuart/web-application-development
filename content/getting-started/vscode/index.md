In this module we will be using the *VSCode* text editor to create and edit code files.

<!--more-->

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will help us to write in *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript* and *PHP* and will also act as a **server** that can communicate with the web browser over *HTTP* to create a complete development environment for the web.

>Other code editors are available, but according to the [2023 stackoverflow developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment), VSCode is the most popular text editor with developers by a huge margin.

## Getting started

Download VSCode [for your platform](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and do the normal things.
Installation should be fairly painless. 

Check out the [official videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos#VSCode). 
In particular, this video will give you a good start.

> For obvious reasons, we would prefer it if you watched video content outside of timetabled lab sessions.
> You should use the sessions to work through exercises, experiment and to ask questions.


## Conclusions

VSCode is a powerful editor and will allow you to write code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL with full syntax highlighting and "intellisense" auto-completion.

We will see that we can also install extensions to run web servers and even PHP servers directly from VScode making it the core software for developing our code.
