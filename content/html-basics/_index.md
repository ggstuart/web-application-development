Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the main tool for describing content on the web.
It is an open standard and one of the core technologies originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee.

HTML documents are simple text files.
We wrap content with HTML tags to indicate the meaning of the content.

When we browse to a website, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server. 
The server may return static HTML files or generate the HTML content dynamically.

Front-end web development is all about working within the browser to construct user interfaces using HTML as the core technology.

This introductory unit will cover the basics, assuming you know nothing about HTML.
We will attempt to cover the main topics and leave you with enough experience to find what you need on the web.
