            Images are a good example of content where accessibility concerns are an important factor.

            <h2>An example of poor accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                The following image is essentially invisible to a screen reader.
                We can tell there is an image, but we have no idea what it is showing.
            </p>
            <img src="https://placekitten.com/200">

        <section>
            <h2>A hidden image</h2>
            <p>
                This next image has an empty <em>alt attribute</em>.
                Notice the impact this has on the screen reader.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>An example of good accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                This next image is much better because it has a non-empty <em>alt attribute</em>. 
                The alternative text briefly describes the image for users who cannot see it.
            </p>
            <img src="https://placekitten.com/200" alt="a random kitten, looking cute">

        <section>
            <h2>An even better example?</h2>
            <p>
                Using a figure with a caption might be even better in some cases.
                The <em>alt attribute</em> should still describe the image for those who cannot see it.
                Adding a <em>caption</em> provides a description which is clearly tied to the image.
                The caption is accessible to all users.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="https://placekitten.com/200" alt="the same random kitten, still cute">
                <figcaption>
                    Figure captions are associated with the figure content.
