        <p>
            Images are a good example of content where accessibility concerns are an important factor.

        <h2>An even better example?</h2>
        <p>
            Using a figure with a caption might be even better in some cases.
            Adding a <em>caption</em> provides a description which is clearly tied to the image.
            The caption is accessible to all users.
            The <em>alt attribute</em> should still describe the image for those who cannot see it.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://placecats.com/200/200" alt="the same random cat, still cute">
            <figcaption>
                Figure captions are associated with the figure content.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
