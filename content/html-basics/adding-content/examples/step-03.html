    <h1>This is a level 1 heading</h1>
    <p>
        This is a paragraph of text.
        It can contain multiple lines.
        The line breaks will be reduced to single spaces.
        As will any gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each paragraph element will take up the full width of the viewport.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even if the text is short.
        The element itself is a rectangle which <em>flows</em> into the layout according to specific rules.
