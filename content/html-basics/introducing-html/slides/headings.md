Headings come in six levels from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.
Headings provide accessibility landmarks for assistive technologies and should provide a navigable document structure. 
For most circumstances, six levels is too much.


```html

<h1>Level 1</h1>
<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h3>Level 3</h3>
```
> There should usually only be one `<h1>` element providing a visual title for the whole document.

# Level 1
## Level 2
### Level 3
