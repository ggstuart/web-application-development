Lists are collections of list items (`<li>`) which contain the actual content. List items are wrapped in containers that come in two main forms.

> Unordered lists (`<ul>`) generate bullet points and should be used when order doesn't matter (e.g. ingredient list).

> Ordered lists (`<ol>`) generate numbered lists and should only be used when order matters (e.g recipe steps).

```html
<ul>
    <li>Unordered one</li>
    <li>Unordered two</li>
    <li>Unordered three</li>
</ul>
```

```html
<ol>
    <li>Ordered one</li>
    <li>Ordered two</li>
    <li>Ordered three</li>
</ol>
```

>- Unordered one
>- Unordered two
>- Unordered three

>1. Ordered one
>1. Ordered two
>1. Ordered three

Using lists provide screen reader users with a much nicer experience.
