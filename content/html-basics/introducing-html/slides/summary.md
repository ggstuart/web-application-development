- HTML **documents** have a `<!doctype html>` and an `<html>` element
- The `<head>` element contains information **about** the document
- The `<body>` element contains **visible** content
- **Structure** is important, use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` etc.
- Use **semantic** elements wherever possible
- Pay attention to **nesting** and **indentation**
- You don't need to learn *all* the HTML elements
- **Validate** your code regularly.

Now take this into the lab.
