This unit covers responsive web design and media queries.

This week we will cover responsive layouts and animations. We will also cover some basic JavaScript for simple interactions and manipulation of the DOM.

The core of [responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) is that we cannot make assumptions about the size of the viewport in the users device.
We can use [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries) to detect characteristics of the device and to apply styles conditionally.
