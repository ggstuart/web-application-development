>*"The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility."*
>
>**John Allsopp**, [A Dao of web design](https://alistapart.com/article/dao/)

Devices are not all the same.
This is a power of the web that transcends the printed page.
Web content flows into the viewport.

> *"Start designing from the content out, rather than the canvas in."* - **Mark Boulton**
