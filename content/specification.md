title: Module specification
---

This module provides a thorough grounding in the rapidly evolving area of web technologies. With equal focus on user interface design on the ‘client-side’ or ‘front-end’ and on security and persistence in ‘server-side’ or ‘back-end’ scripting. 

The module covers crucial design principles, information architecture and usability factors as well as standards compliance, accessibility, authentication/authorisation and security. 

 

This exciting field has been driven by advances in web standards, in particular HTML5 (introduced in 2008 and accepted as a ‘living standard’ in May 2019), modular CSS (~2012) and the ECMAScript standard (ECMAScript2015 in particular) which together define the modern web platform. The web standards process enables the platform to evolve extremely quickly, and new features are released with increasing regularity. 

 

Modern web applications typically make heavy use of server-side scripting using development languages such as PHP. This pragmatic language is used to great effect by some web developers and with catastrophic naivety by others. Web application solutions are typically implemented by teams of developers. The various roles typically undertaken will be discussed with students.
