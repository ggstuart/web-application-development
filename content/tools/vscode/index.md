In this module we will be using the [VSCode text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to create and edit code files.
VSCode will help us to write in *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript* and *PHP*.

>Other code editors are available, but according to the [2023 stackoverflow developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment), VSCode is the most popular text editor with developers by a huge margin.
