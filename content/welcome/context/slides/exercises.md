> We have three exercises as a basic introduction to VSCode and Google Chrome and a quick exploratory pass over loads of front-end concepts.

- Getting to grips with VSCode, using **emmet** for efficiency and the **live server** extension. 
- Exploring the **browser developer tools** and viewing a website from the developers perspective.
- Building a very basic website with *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*.
