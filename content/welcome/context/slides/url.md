![URI syntax diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/URI_syntax_diagram.svg)

URLs are broken into their component pieces using the pattern described above.<br><br> 
e.g. **https:\//www.example.com/some-document.html?key=value#some-element**

- *scheme*: **https**
- *host*: **www.example.com**
- *path*: **/some-document.html**
- *query*: **key=value**
- *fragment*: **#some-element**

> Browsers make calls to DNS to lookup the domain name and convert it to an IP address which it uses to communicate to the server.
