> "**Java** is to *JavaScript* as **car** is to *carpet*" <br>- Chris Heilmann

- Invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the Netscape 2 browser.
- Originally called Mocha, then LiveScript. 
- It was renamed to Javascript *to sound a bit like Java, as a marketing ploy*.
- Internet Explorer shipped with a reverse-engineered equivalent JScript in 1996
- JScript and Javascript were incompatible, obviously.
